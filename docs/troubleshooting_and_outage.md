# Database Troubleshooting & Outage Guide

In case you encounter any issues or outages with the InfluxDB Database hosted by Superclustr, this guide will help you through the steps you should take to resolve or report these incidents. The Superclustr Operations Team is committed to ensuring the smooth running of all services, and your input helps us achieve this.

## Reporting an Issue

If you experience any issues with the database, we encourage you to report it directly to us. Please reach out to our operations team at [ops@superclustr.net](mailto:ops@superclustr.net) with a description of your issue.

When reporting an issue, please include as many details as possible:

- A brief description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable)
- Any error messages you've received
- The impact of the issue on your operations

Upon receiving your report, we will endeavor to respond promptly. Your issue will be investigated, and you will be updated with our findings and potential solutions.

## Monitoring Outages

For any outage-related incidents, you can check the real-time status of our services on the Superclustr Status page at [https://status.superclustr.net/](https://status.superclustr.net/).

We use this page to keep users informed about any ongoing outages, as well as the steps we are taking towards resolving them. Please bookmark this page for easy reference in the future.

## During an Outage

During an outage:

1. Check the [Superclustr Status page](https://status.superclustr.net/) for updates on the issue.
2. Avoid making major changes to your system or your database until the outage is resolved. Such changes may complicate the issue further.
3. Notify your team or stakeholders about the outage to manage expectations.

## Post-Outage

Once an outage is resolved, we will update the [Superclustr Status page](https://status.superclustr.net/) accordingly. We advise you to confirm that your services are running correctly post-outage. If you notice any further issues, please report them to our operations team.

## Questions and Feedback

We appreciate your patience during incidents and outages and welcome your feedback on how we can improve our response. If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback about how we manage incidents, please email [ops@superclustr.net](mailto:ops@superclustr.net).
